                <li>I am Mython M. Dumayao writing this testimony to express my utmost admiration in training. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can impact student learning when teachers are digitally literate and understand how to integrate it into curriculum. It is the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. Introducing my testimony about Information and Communication Technology (ICT), I am compelled to share the profound impact that ICT has had on my life. From transforming the way, I learn and work to revolutionizing how I connect with others, ICT has been a catalyst for personal growth and empowerment. In this testimony, I will hunt through into the ways in which ICT has shaped my experiences, enriched my relationships, and empowered me to landscape with mindfulness and purpose. As a teacher and a learner too in this training, understanding the impact of Information and Communication Technology is crucial in today’s digital age. ICT plays a significant role in shaping how we learn, access information, and interact with the world around us. In day 1, the topic was computer hardware and software and troubleshooting basic problem, I knew a lot about hardware and software and its uses. In using a desktop computer on a regular basis, there are many problems might occur, and don’t be panic, figuring it out how to identify and solve the troubleshoot of a computer. In day 2, the topic was making a spreadsheet, Microsoft excel and creating a chart. As I knew that spreadsheet is commonly used for accounting and it displays a grid consisting of columns and rows. I knew also that the creation of Microsoft Excel and creating charts that it stands as a testament to the power of innovation and technology in enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision making. In day 3 the topic was applying arithmetic formula and function in spreadsheets, the function of MAX and MIN formulas in Excel get the largest and smallest value in a set of numbers. In day 4, the topic was creating presentation in Microsoft Power point. To make a power point presentation was more engaging, you can improve it up with multimedia. This includes background design, videos, photos, audio, transition and animation. In creating presentation, it encourages learners to use storytelling techniques to convey information that you apply to ICT class sessions. And lastly in day 5, the topic was creating a web page, was a transformative experience that empowers individuals especially learners to establish a digital presence, share information, and connect with a global audience. In this process of creating a web page empowers individuals and businesses to share their stories, showcase their expertise, and engage with a global community in a dynamic and impactful way.
